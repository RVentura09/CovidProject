# CovidProject
## Project Overview
This project aims to analyze and visualize COVID-19 data, highlighting trends and insights related to the pandemic's impact. Using SQL for data extraction and Tableau for visualization, the project  work with real-world datasets and present findings in a clear and engaging manner.

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to showcase my proficiency in SQL and data visualization techniques. SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) was used for database management, while Tableau Public was utilized for data visualization.

## Content Description
- **Dataset**: The project includes two `.xlsx` files that are used in the SQL queries. These datasets are extracted from a COVID-19 database available at [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths).

- **SQL Queries**: There are two `.sql` files containing queries designed to explore the previously mentioned datasets. Each file includes a total of six queries.

- **Tableau Dashboard**: This folder contains the project in `.twb` format and an image of the final dashboard `Dashboard.jpg`.The dashboard is also available at [TableauPublic](https://public.tableau.com/views/TableauDashboard_17298852675510/Dashboard1?:language=en-US&publish=yes&:sid=&:redirect=auth&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link). Additionally, it includes a summary of the queries performed on the original dataset in the file `TableauQueries.sql`. Within the TableauDataset folder, you will find the results of these queries in `.csv` format.
