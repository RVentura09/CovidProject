# CovidProject
Project Overview
This project demonstrates my skills in SQL and data visualization using Tableau, utilizing COVID-19 data.

Purpose
The purpose of this project is to showcase my proficiency in SQL and data visualization techniques. SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) was used for database management, while Tableau Public was utilized for data visualization.

Content Description
Dataset: The project includes two .xlsx files that are used in the SQL queries. These datasets are extracted from a COVID-19 database available at Our World in Data.

SQL Queries: There are two .sql files containing queries designed to explore the aforementioned datasets. Each file includes a total of six queries.

Tableau Dashboard: This folder contains the project in .twb format and an image of the final dashboard (Dashboard.jpg). Additionally, it includes a summary of the queries performed on the original dataset in the file TableauQueries.sql. Within the TableauDataset folder, you will find the results of these queries in .csv format.
